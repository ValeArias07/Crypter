# Crypterüîê
Crypter is a program that encrypts and decrypts text by console or file using classic one-letter replacement encryption techniques like the Cesar and Atbash algorithm, polyalphabetic replacement encryption like Vigen√®re, and a special encryption algorithm inspired by AES.

**Starting screen**

On this screen you will find 3 options:

**Encrypt and Decrypt**

Once you select Encrypt or Decrypt, a window will be displayed that will have the Settings option in the upper left

![Settings](https://github.com/ValeArias07/Crypter-/blob/master/src/images/Setting_Encrypt.png)

In this part you will have to select 2 options:

**TextInput:** Here you will have to choose if you want to enter the text through the console or through a text file.

**Cosole:** If you select console, a window opens to write the text.

**Text file:** If you select by a text file, the option to search for a document (.txt) on your computer is enabled.

**Method type:** You must choose a type of encryption or decryption method, either monoalphabetical or polyalphabetical.

**Monoalphabetic:** Within this section you will find two methods of encryption and decryption:

**Polialphabetic:** Within this section you will find two methods of encryption and decryption:

**Vigen√®re**

**AES**

**Editing text: **This is the window that is displayed when you want to change the format of an encrypted or decrypted text. You can change the letter, its size, color, among others.

**Route Manager**

![Route_Manager](https://github.com/ValeArias07/Crypter-/blob/master/src/images/Route_Manager.png)

Here you will have the possibility to manage the files that you have encrypted or decrypted. You can delete files or view them, where you can also edit the text format
